# Yahtzee
This is another project I created in my Web Design Class. It simulates playing the top half of the score card in a Yahtzee game.
It is the first project I have used JavaScript for. I had learned Java in my AP Computer Science class, so coding with the JavaScript
was fairly similar, except for the functionality of using the JavaScript to alter the HTML content. I still have a long way to go in
using JavaScript (and coding in general), but this was a fun project to test my current skills!
